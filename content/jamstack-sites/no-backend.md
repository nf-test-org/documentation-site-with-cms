## Entire Project on a CDN

Because JAMstack projects donâ€™t rely on server-side code, they can be distributed instead of living on a single server. Serving directly from a CDN unlocks speeds and performance that can't be beat. The more of your app you can push to the edge, the better the user experience.

## Everything Lives in Git

With a JAMstack project, anyone should be able to do a `git clone` , install any needed dependencies with a standard procedure (like `npm install`), and be ready to run the full project locally. No databases to clone, no complex installs. This reduces contributor friction, and also simplifies staging and testing workflows.

## Modern Build Tools

Take advantage of the world of modern build tools. It can be a jungle to get oriented in and it's a fast moving space, but you'll want to be able to use tomorrow's web standards today without waiting for tomorrow's browsers. And that currently means, Babel, PostCSS, Webpack, and friends.
