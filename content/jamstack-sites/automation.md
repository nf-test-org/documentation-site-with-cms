## Automated Builds

Because JAMstack markup is prebuilt, content changes won’t go live until you run another build. Automating this process will save you lots of headache. You can do this yourself with webhooks, or use a publishing platform that includes the service automatically.

## Atomic Deploys

As JAMstack projects grow really large, new changes might require re-deploying hundreds of files. Uploading these one at a time can cause inconsistent state while the process completes. You can avoid this with a system that lets you do "atomic deploys," where no changes go live until all changed files have been uploaded.

## Instant Cache Invalidation

When the build-to-deploy cycle becomes a regular occurrence, you need to know that when a deploy goes live, it really goes live. Eliminate any doubt by making sure your CDN can handle instant cache purges.
